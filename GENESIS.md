# OKExChain Genesis

## Regenerating the Genesis File

The genesis file can be regenerated by anyone based on the subcomponents of the repository.

To regenerate the genesis file, ensure the repository root is within `$GOPATH/src` and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

A few lines of text should be printed, followed by three lines listing the total address count, total OKT supply, and total gentx count, and `genesis.json` should be written.

## Genesis Validator

The `gentx` was held to determine an initial validator set for the recommended
genesis state. The `gentx` allowed one with a recommended allocation of OKTs
to submit a signed "genesis transaction" declaring their intention to be in the initial
validator set. 

A total of 21 valid gentx submissions were merged into the `gentx` directory and are
included in the recommended genesis state. 2/3 of these validators by stake will need to come online in order for the network to start.
